OBJECTIVE:

I want to build cool stuff with good people, while learning a lot along the way.
Oh, and money -- I'd like a big pile of that.


EXPERIENCE:

** Software Engineer / Investor; self-employed; Oct. 2019 - present **

I've developed software to help me manage my personal capital. This software allows me to test out
and validate hundreds of different investing strategies, find a handful of uncorrelated strategies
that generate the best risk-adjusted returns, and allocate my funds accordingly. I've roughly
doubled my money since I started doing this, but that might be mostly luck.


** Software Engineer; freelance; Jul. 2018 - Oct. 2019 **

I left Airbnb because I wanted to build an AI that could write code. I decided the best way to
approach this would be to become a freelancer and try to automate myself away over time. I saw
WordPress and eCommerce were in high demand so I decided to focus on that. I successfully completed
17 projects; check out https://www.bigscreensoftware.com/ to see my reviews. Ultimately I found
writing code is the easy part -- the hard part is finding strong enough customer demand to justify
significant investment in software.


** Software Engineer; Airbnb; Feb. 2017 - Jul. 2018 **

As a full-stack Rails developer, I helped build the Airbnb Plus program (airbnb.com/plus). I worked
on the supply-side (getting hosts into Plus). My work included building out our host communications
infrastructure and developing a tool for doing standards enforcement.


** Software Engineer; Gigwalk; Dec. 2015 - Feb. 2017 **

Developed and maintained the Python backend of a large-scale web application used to manage and
coordinate distributed workforces.  I worked with Flask, Postgres, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Celery,
and numerous related technologies on a daily basis.  I built several new features, fixed many
bugs, and promoted good software engineering practices.


** Software Engineer; Instacart; 2015 **

Worked on the Rails backend of Instacart's shopper app.  The app is used daily by tens of thousands
of grocery delivery contractors.  My work involved adding new features, fixing bugs, and being
on-call for critical outages for a rapidly growing product.


** Independent Developer; 2013 - 2015 **

Decided to try and start a startup.  Worked on several different ideas.  The one I spent the most
time on was TaskRanger.com, a unique time tracking tool (now defunct).  I built it with AngularJS
and Firebase.


** Software Developer; Zenoss; 2012 - 2013 **

Fixed bugs and provided engineering support to high-value customers for an industry leading
infrastructure monitoring product.  Worked with Zope, MySQL, RRDtool, Linux (CentOS), Python, Java,
Neo4J, and a lot more.


** Python/Django Engineer; Mutual Mobile; 2011 - 2012 **

Worked on cross-functional teams of designers and developers to build award winning mobile
solutions for Fortune 500 companies.  Worked extensively with Python, Django, PostgreSQL,
Linux (Ubuntu), AWS, and other related technologies.  You can find a list of their clients here:

More specifically, during my time here I:

- Wrote the CMS backend for an iPad app we developed for a major telecommunications company.
The app is currently being used by over 10,000 salespeople.

- Built a scalable, clustered video processing server for use with a large consumer iOS app.

- Built a recording proxy server and data validation toolset which made integrating with unreliable
third party web services less painful.


** Web Developer; Texas Faculty Association; 2010 - 2011 **

Designed, built, and maintained http://tfaonline.net

Also built a content management system which made it easy to post articles to the site and maintain
the mailing-list.


** Independent Developer (Developer Tools); 2009 â€” 2010 **

I spent a year exploring my interest in programmer productivity. I built a variety of tools for
increasing developer efficiency. During this time I worked primarily with Python and PyQt, before
eventually moving on to Javascript and Jquery.


** Independent Developer (Computer Games); 2004 - 2009 **

I spent a few years developing computer games independently along with a few friends. We worked
with C++ and Java. I used SDL, OpenGL, DirectX, and various other game related libraries. My most
successful game from this period, Space Grabber, was played by tens of thousands of people.
